This is a lexical analyzer and a parser for the RPAL language. 
Refer RPAL_Lex.pdf for the lexical rules and RPAL_Grammar.pdf for the grammar details.  
Output of the parser is an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) for the given input program. 
Then we implemented an algorithm to convert the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) in to Standardize Tree (ST) and implement CSE machine. 
Our program is able to read an input file which contains a RPAL program.
