# Placeholder for defining the accepting states of an FSA lexer
# and the token type associated with each accepting state.
# The current regex-based lexer in screener.py does not use this.

# Example structure (if implemented):
# ACCEPT_STATES = {
#    1: 'IDENTIFIER',
#    2: 'INTEGER',
#    3: 'OPERATOR',
#    # ... etc ...
# }
# # Might also include lookahead logic or keyword checking here.
